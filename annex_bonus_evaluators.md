**ANNEX: EVALUATOR PERSPECTIVE**

As an evaluator, your role is crucial in assessing the quality and potential impact of project proposals submitted for funding. This bonus section is dedicated to providing valuable insights and suggestions from the evaluator's perspective. By understanding what evaluators look for in project proposals and how they assess them, you can craft a compelling and persuasive proposal that stands out and increases your chances of securing funding. Let's dive into the evaluator's perspective and discover how you can make their lives easier while maximizing the impact of your research proposal.

## 1. Clarity is Key

One of the first things evaluators appreciate is a clear and concise project proposal. When reviewing a proposal, evaluators are often pressed for time, and a well-organized and easily comprehensible document can make their job significantly easier. Here are some tips to enhance clarity:

- **Structure your proposal**: Use clear headings and subheadings to guide evaluators through the proposal. Provide a logical flow and outline the main sections, such as introduction, objectives, methodology, and expected results.

- **Use clear and concise language**: Avoid jargon and technical terms that may be unfamiliar to evaluators from different backgrounds. Be mindful of your audience and communicate your ideas in a way that is accessible to a broad range of evaluators.

- **Provide context and background**: Clearly define the problem statement and the context in which your research takes place. Explain why your research is important, relevant, and timely. This will help evaluators understand the significance of your proposal.

- **Use visuals and graphics strategically**: Visual representations, such as charts, graphs, and diagrams, can help convey complex information more effectively. Use visuals sparingly and ensure they enhance, rather than clutter, the proposal.

## 2. Align with the Evaluation Criteria

Evaluators assess project proposals based on specific evaluation criteria. By aligning your proposal with these criteria, you can make it easier for evaluators to evaluate and score your proposal. Here are some general evaluation criteria to consider:

- **Relevance**: Demonstrate how your research addresses a significant problem or gap, aligns with European research priorities, and contributes to advancing knowledge and innovation.

- **Excellence**: Showcase the originality, scientific quality, and feasibility of your research. Highlight any novel methodologies, frameworks, or interdisciplinary approaches you plan to employ.

- **Impact**: Clearly articulate the potential impact of your research. Describe the expected outcomes and how they will benefit society, the research community, and relevant stakeholders.

- **Implementation**: Provide a detailed and feasible work plan, including timelines, deliverables, and milestones. Show that you have considered potential risks and have strategies in place to address them.

- **Dissemination and exploitation**: Outline how you plan to communicate your research findings and ensure their maximum impact. Consider how you will engage with stakeholders and potential end-users of your research.

## 3. Demonstrate Collaboration and Engagement

Evaluators appreciate proposals that demonstrate effective collaboration and engagement strategies. By highlighting your efforts to engage with relevant stakeholders and the research community, you can showcase the potential for broader impact and ensure that your research resonates with evaluators . To make evaluators' lives easier, consider the following points:

- **Collaboration with stakeholders**: Clearly outline how you plan to involve relevant stakeholders throughout the research process. This could include industry partners, policymakers, community organizations, or end-users. Demonstrating strong collaboration and engagement will show evaluators that your research has real-world relevance and is likely to have a greater impact.

- **Engagement with the research community**: Highlight your commitment to sharing knowledge and collaborating with other researchers in your field. Describe how you plan to participate in conferences, workshops, and other scholarly activities to disseminate your findings and contribute to the academic community.

- **Capacity-building opportunities**: If your research proposal includes capacity-building components, such as training programs or knowledge transfer activities, emphasize the potential for long-term impact and sustainability. Evaluators appreciate proposals that not only contribute to research advancements but also empower individuals and institutions to carry the work forward.

## 4. Address Potential Concerns

Anticipating and addressing potential concerns or challenges in your proposal signals to evaluators that you have carefully considered the project's feasibility. By proactively addressing these concerns, you can make evaluators' lives easier by providing them with all the necessary information upfront. Some potential concerns that evaluators may have include:

- **Budget and funding**: Ensure that your budget is well-defined, realistic, and aligned with the proposed activities. Clearly articulate how the requested funds will be allocated and demonstrate sound financial planning.

- **Project risks**: Acknowledge and address potential risks and uncertainties in your project proposal. Provide contingency plans and mitigation strategies to assure evaluators that you have considered and planned for possible obstacles.

- **Ethical considerations**: If your research involves human subjects, animals, or other ethical concerns, clearly outline how you will adhere to ethical guidelines and obtain any necessary approvals. Demonstrate that you have thoughtfully considered the ethical implications of your research and have plans in place to protect the rights and well-being of participants or subjects.

- **Data management and sharing**: Describe how you will handle data throughout the project, including storage, security, and long-term preservation. Additionally, outline your data management and sharing plans, ensuring compliance with relevant policies and regulations.

## 5. Provide Comprehensive and Accessible Information

Finally, to make evaluators' lives easier, ensure that your proposal provides comprehensive and accessible information. By presenting all the necessary details clearly and concisely, you enable evaluators to make informed decisions without having to hunt for essential information. Consider the following tips:

- **Provide a well-structured Table of Contents**: A well-organized Table of Contents allows evaluators to navigate the proposal easily. Include page numbers for quick reference.

- **Use headings and subheadings**: Break down the content into sections with clear headings and subheadings. This helps evaluators locate specific information quickly.

- **Include a concise Executive Summary**: Summarize the key points of your proposal in a concise Executive Summary. This summary should briefly describe the problem, your proposed solution, and the potential impact.

- **Support claims with evidence**: Back up your claims and statements with credible and relevant evidence. This could include references to previous research, statistical data, or case studies.

- **Use visuals to enhance understanding**: Incorporate visuals, such as charts, graphs, or diagrams, to present complex information in a visually appealing and easily understandable format.

- **Proofread and edit**: Ensure that your proposal is error-free, grammatically correct, and well-formatted. Typos, grammar mistakes, and formatting issues can distract evaluators and detract from the overall quality of your proposal.

By considering these tips and addressing the evaluator's perspective, you can significantly improve the clarity, comprehensiveness, and persuasiveness of your project proposal. Ultimately, by making evaluators' lives easier, you increase the likelihood of securing funding for your research and maximizing its impact in the scientific community and beyond.
