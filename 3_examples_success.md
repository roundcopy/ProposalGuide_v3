Here are some examples of successful proposals and case studies of researchers who secured Horizon grants:

Example 1: Dr. Anna Schmidt, a materials scientist, secured a €2 million Horizon Europe grant for her project on developing novel composites for wind turbine blades. Her successful proposal included:

- A compelling project summary highlighting the objectives, methodology, and impact
- Strong letters of support from industry partners who would help test and implement the composites
- Details of an experienced, cross-disciplinary project team across multiple universities 
- A detailed work plan breaking down the project into work packages, tasks, milestones and deliverables
- A clear and justified budget allocating resources to each work package

By aligning closely with the call topic priorities and collaborating with key partners, Dr. Schmidt developed a robust proposal that convinced evaluators to fund her project. The grant allowed her team to undertake cutting-edge research that led to more durable wind turbine blades, reduced maintenance costs, and advances in composite technology.

Example 2: Dr. Thomas Muller, an epidemiologist, received a €1.5 million ERC Starting Grant for his project to map the spread of infectious diseases using big data analytics. His successful proposal contained:

- A clear description of the research challenges and how his methodology would address gaps in existing approaches
- Details of his track record of research excellence, such as publications, awards, and media coverage
- Strong letters of support highlighting his expertise and potential for groundbreaking discoveries
- A detailed work plan justified by past papers and preliminary research findings
- A realistic budget for staff, equipment, conferences, and research activities 

By showcasing his expertise, thought leadership, and proposing an ambitious project aligned with ERC’s objectives, Dr. Muller convinced evaluators to fund his novel approach. His research led to new predictive models for epidemics that are now used by policymakers across Europe.
