They knew that water scarcity is a major problem in many parts of the world, and they wanted to develop a more efficient way to purify water. They identified a compelling idea: to develop a new water purification system that would use solar energy.

The researchers validated their idea by working with collaborators in Europe. They conducted a series of experiments to test the effectiveness of their new water purification system. They also worked with engineers to develop a plan for how to scale up the production of the system.

The researchers aligned their idea with the priorities of Horizon 2020. They submitted a grant proposal to Horizon 2020, and their proposal was successful. The grant funding allowed them to continue their research and to develop a prototype of their new water purification system.

The outcome of this project was the development of a new water purification system that is more efficient and cost-effective than existing treatments. The system has the potential to provide clean water to people in areas where water scarcity is a problem.

**Case Study 3: The development of a new sustainable battery**

A team of researchers from France and Sweden were interested in developing a new sustainable battery. They knew that batteries are essential for many modern technologies, but they wanted to develop a battery that was more environmentally friendly. They identified a compelling idea: to develop a new battery that would use graphene.

The researchers validated their idea by working with collaborators in Europe. They conducted a series of experiments to test the effectiveness of their new battery. They also worked with engineers to develop a plan for how to scale up the production of the battery.

The researchers aligned their idea with the priorities of Horizon 2020. They submitted a grant proposal to Horizon 2020, and their proposal was successful. The grant funding allowed them to continue their research and to develop a prototype of their new battery.

The outcome of this project was the development of a new battery that is more sustainable than existing batteries. The battery has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of battery production and use.

**Case Study 4: The development of a new drug for Alzheimer's disease**

A team of researchers from the Netherlands and Belgium were interested in developing a new drug for Alzheimer's disease. They knew that Alzheimer's disease is a devastating disease, and they wanted to develop a drug that could slow the progression of the disease. They identified a compelling idea: to develop a new drug that would target the amyloid plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

The researchers validated their idea by working with collaborators in Europe. They conducted a series of experiments to test the effectiveness of their new drug. They also worked with clinicians to develop a plan for how to test the drug in clinical trials.

The researchers aligned their idea with the priorities of Horizon 2020. They submitted a grant proposal to Horizon 2020, and their proposal was successful. The grant funding allowed them to continue their research and to conduct clinical trials of their new drug.

The outcome of this project was the development of a new drug that is more effective than existing treatments for Alzheimer's disease. The drug has the potential to improve the lives of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families.

Sure, here are two more case studies:

**Case Study 5: The development of a new method for detecting cancer**

A team of researchers from Portugal and Spain were interested in developing a new method for detecting cancer. They knew that early detection is key to successful cancer treatment, and they wanted to develop a method that was more accurate and less invasive than existing methods. They identified a compelling idea: to develop a new method that would use machine learning to analyze images of cells.

The researchers validated their idea by working with collaborators in Europe. They conducted a series of experiments to test the accuracy of their new method. They also worked with clinicians to develop a plan for how to use the method in clinical trials.

The researchers aligned their idea with the priorities of Horizon 2020. They submitted a grant proposal to Horizon 2020, and their proposal was successful. The grant funding allowed them to continue their research and to develop a prototype of their new method.

The outcome of this project was the development of a new method for detecting cancer that is more accurate and less invasive than existing methods. The method has the potential to save lives by enabling earlier detection of cancer.

**Case Study 6: The development of a new way to produce food**

A team of researchers from the Netherlands and Denmark were interested in developing a new way to produce food. They knew that the global population is expected to grow by 2 billion people by 2050, and they wanted to develop a way to produce more food in a sustainable way. They identified a compelling idea: to develop a new way to produce food that would use vertical farming.

Vertical farming is a method of growing food in vertically stacked layers. This method uses less land and water than traditional methods of farming, and it can be located in urban areas.

The researchers validated their idea by working with collaborators in Europe. They conducted a series of experiments to test the feasibility of vertical farming. They also worked with farmers to develop a plan for how to implement vertical farming on a commercial scale.

The researchers aligned their idea with the priorities of Horizon 2020. They submitted a grant proposal to Horizon 2020, and their proposal was successful. The grant funding allowed them to continue their research and to develop a prototype of their new vertical farming system.

The outcome of this project was the development of a new way to produce food that is more sustainable and efficient than traditional methods. The system has the potential to help to feed the growing global population in a sustainable way.
