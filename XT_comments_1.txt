- Emphasize that this book provides a proven, step-by-step system to help researchers succeed. This will build confidence that the book delivers on its promises.

## Chapter 1

- This chapter provides helpful context on choosing the right research idea. 

- Consider adding more examples and stories to illustrate how researchers have validated ideas, prioritized projects, and aligned with European priorities successfully. This brings concepts to life.

- Add a checkpoint/summary at the end of the chapter to recap key takeaways and help readers self-assess their progress on identifying the right research idea.

## Chapter 2 

- Provides excellent, actionable strategies for building research profile. Well done.

- The section on cultivating industry collaborations could be expanded. Add tips on how to effectively pitch your ideas to industry partners. 

- Include a downloadable template/checklist of key steps for building research profile. This adds value for readers.

## Chapter 3

- The fellowship section could be expanded with examples of specific European fellowships, eligibility criteria, and application processes. Providing actionable details will add value.

- For salary negotiation section, provide benchmark salary ranges for different research roles and career stages in Europe. This provides readers context.

## Conclusion

- The conclusion does a good job of summarizing key insights and inspiring readers to take action. 

- Consider adding a clear call-to-action for readers to visit your website, subscribe to your newsletter etc. This will allow you to continue engaging and supporting them after they finish the book.
