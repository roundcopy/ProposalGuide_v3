Abstract Example

Magnetic Nanoparticle-enhanced MRI for Early Cancer Detection

Authors: Jane Smith, John Lee, Imperial College London

Early detection of cancer significantly improves treatment outcomes and survival rates. This study investigates using magnetic nanoparticles as MRI contrast agents to improve sensitivity in detecting small tumors. Magnetic nanoparticles were functionalized with cancer cell-specific antibodies using carbodiimide chemistry. In vivo studies using mouse models demonstrated nanoparticle-enhanced MRI was able to detect tumors <2mm in size compared to 5mm for conventional MRI. This nanotechnology-enhanced imaging technique shows promise for early diagnosis, enabling earlier interventions and improved prognosis.
