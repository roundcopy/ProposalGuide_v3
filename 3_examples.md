* **Tailor your proposal to the funder.** Read the funder's website and understand their priorities.
* **Tell a story.** Your proposal should be more than just a list of research objectives. It should tell a story about the problem that you are trying to solve and the impact that your project will have.
* **Get feedback.** Ask colleagues, mentors, and other experts to review your proposal and give you feedback.

I hope this helps!
